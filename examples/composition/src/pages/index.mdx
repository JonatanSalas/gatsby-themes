# Gatsby Theme Composition Sandbox

This example is for exploring component-based composition patterns for combining layout, typography, and colors in a really flexible way.
This example should serve as the basis for other themes to be abstracted out and doesn't use themes directly.

## Core Tenets

- Styling concerns should be kept separate to allow for composition
- General-purpose abstractions should be easy to understand
- Combinations should be customizable through style overrides
